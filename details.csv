They are the most demanded energy sources and their consumption has been increasing. However, there is a need to improve coal combustion performance to enhance the efficiency of the furnace and boiler. Addition of additives to both the fuels is an option and has led to focus by researchers for developing an additive. Such additives can effectively improve the combustion performance of coal and lignite. A study on the subject would contribute to providing information about the impact of additives on combustion properties, calorific value, and a hybrid technology that may use additives to modify the coal/lignite surface. Thus, the objective of this study is to relate the effect of additives on utilization and combustion performances of both the fuels. Improved efficiency and reduced emissions from coal/lignite power stations would lead to development of present and future efficient coal/lignite combustion technologies. Upgrading coal, reducing emission of NOx, SOx and particulate matter, and corrosion are some of the factors in the development of efficient coal technologies. The process may be developed through bench, pilot and full scale. It would be tested at lab scale and in actual operation.Required Skills &amp; Traits: Instrumentation/Chemical AnalysisExpected Outcomes: Understanding of Combustion Properties, Additive Development and ApplicationSpecific courses required for project execution: Chemical Engineering/Materials Science &amp; Engineering/Chemistry",CHEMISTRY,"Title: Development of Coal and Lignite additives to improve their combustions, efficiency, calorific value, and Reduction in pollution levels"

This used to be costly, time-consuming, and laborious for mine areas with difficult terrain. With the advent of latest technologies; especially field portable analytical instruments viz. portable visible and near-infrared spectrophotometers, gamma-ray spectrometer, LED fluorimeter, pXRF, pXRD, pLIBS, and µRaman spectrometer; their on-site use has increased in mineral exploration. Furthermore, use of these instruments on site do help in quick, real-time, non-destructive, and cost-effective identification, and determination of indicator minerals and pathfinder elements in rock and its ore, in soil sediment, and in water samples. Such portable analytical instruments determine accurate chemical and mineralogical data during the field visits with virtually no or minimum laboratory analysis; thus bypassing the need for sample collection. The information so obtained helps in decision making in carrying out field work and also during drilling operations in mineral exploration. In our research use of such portable devices would be made in carrying out exploration studies for Gold (Au), Silver (Ag), Rubidium (Rb), Hafnium (Hf), Zirconium (Zr), and a range of Rare-Earth Elements (REs) in Al-rich regions.
